## Overview

The `common` folder contains smaller, widely-used components that are shared across the application. These components include buttons, form elements, BREADCRUMB, SEARCHBAR and other UI elements that are frequently used in different parts of the app, promoting consistency and reusability, and reducing redundancy in the codebase.

The `utility.tsx` file in our React application serves as a central repository for various smaller, reusable functions that are utilized throughout the app. This file includes a collection of utility functions that perform common operations such as data formatting, validation, and other helper tasks, ensuring that the codebase remains clean, modular, and easy to maintain. By centralizing these utilities, we promote code reusability and consistency across different components and modules within the application.
